; -------------------------------

; implicit segments are unnamed, so we can deliberately generate enough of
; them to reach the limit without a whole lot of trouble

; a discontinuous program counter by itself does not create a new segment
; because what matters is non-consective data storage

        .repeat $800
        .ds 0
        .ds 2
        .endr

; we can change the program counter as often as we want without creating
; a new segment as long as data storage is continuous

        .echo   "No discontinuous data storage"

; discontinuous data storage is what creates new implicit segments
