; -------------------------------

; this test is meant to show that it is not possible to guarantee
; that a file has not been previously read simply by examining the
; currently unclosed include files
; - the idea is that (by self inclusion) this file is read twice,
; but at the time "READONCE" is executed there are no unclosed inclusions

; -------------------------------

; we can get by with only one test file by using self-inclusion
; (probably not a trick of much use in any other context!)

; here we go...

        INCTEST

        .if         * < ENDADR
        .echo       "Entering..."
        .include    "test253f.a"
        .echo       "...leaving"
        .endif

; -------------------------------

        .readonce               ; executed after inclusion but at base level

; -------------------------------

        .endif      ; defined(INCTEST)

; -------------------------------

; if we use the "END" psop at the end of this file, it will be executed
; when the include file is completely read. That's not what we want, though.
; We want reading to return to the orignal file (ie., itself, but not yet
; at the end when the return happens). Fortunately "END" is not required
; because its effects happen automatically at the end of all source anyway

; of course the above applies only if READONCE doesn't apply

;       .end
