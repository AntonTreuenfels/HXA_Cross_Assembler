; "READONCE" must be used before a file includes any other

; we can get by with only one test file by using self-inclusion
; (probably not a trick of much use in any other context!)

        .if         * < ENDADR
        .echo       "Entering..."

        .endif

; if we use the "END" psop at the end of this file, it will be executed
; the first time the conditional block is completed. That's not what we
; want, though, since the block has to complete about 127 more times
; before the include stack is completely unwound. Fortunately "END" is
; not a required psop because its effects happen automatically at the
; end of source anyway.

; of course the above applies only if READONCE doesn't apply
