        .cpu    "T_16_L"    ; required psop
;        .org    $1000       ; can't use outside of explicit segment

; -------------------------------

; negative values for "DS" are disallowed when explicit segments are
; used for generally the same reasons the use of "ORG" is restricted:
; there is no logical conflict and the assembler can keep track, but
; a) it is potentially confusing to understand,
; b) there is no particular need to ever do it (make another segment), and
; c) it makes the segment map less meaningful

        .segment    testseg ; won't get far enough to make absolute

        .ds     2048        ; ok - implicitly makes segment "uninitialized"
        
        .ds     0           ; ok (silently accepted)

        .ds     -1          ; warn/error

        .ds     1           ; 2049 ( 2048 if previous was allowed)

        .ds     -2050       ; warn/error (out of range in either case)
