; we're interested just in what the error report looks like
; - how easy is it to tell where to find the error in the source ?

; - during second pass no block structure information is available,
; so all we see regarding location is the original source line
; (triggered expansion) and the offset of error line (expansion line)

; a simple definition

        .macro  UNRESOLVED
        .word   unknownLabel
        .endm

; multiple unresolved labels

        .macro  UNRESOLVED_2
        .word   unknownLabel
        .word   unknownAgain
        .endm

; now nest them

        .macro  UNRESOLVED_3
        UNRESOLVED
        UNRESOLVED_2
