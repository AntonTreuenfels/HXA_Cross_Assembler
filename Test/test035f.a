; - during pass one of Test035e, certain malformed Intel-style numbers
; were mis-interpreted as labels
; - these mis-interpretations were not reported because assembly was
; halted after pass one, and detection would not occur until pass two
; - these mis-interpretations are tested separately here, so that
; there are no errors detected during pass one
; - summary: they are still interpreted as labels during pass two, except
; that now errors are reported because they are never defined anywhere
