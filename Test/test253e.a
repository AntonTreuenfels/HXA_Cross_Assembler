        .readonce                   ; warning - circular inclusion

; here we go...

        INCTEST

        .if         * < ENDADR
        .echo       "Entering..."
        .include    "test253e.a"
        .echo       "...leaving"
        .endif

; if we use the "END" psop at the end of this file, it will be executed
; the first time the conditional block is completed. That's not what we
; want, though, since the block has to complete about 127 more times
; before the include stack is completely unwound. Fortunately "END" is
; not a required psop because its effects happen automatically at the
; end of source anyway.

; of course the above applies only if READONCE doesn't apply

;       .end
