; we're interested just in what the error report looks like
; - how easy is it to tell where to find the error in the source ?

; - during first pass block structure information is available and
; we can show all open expansion blocks when an error occurs
; (the last/most recently opened is probably where we want to look
; to solve the problem that causes the error)

; malformed expressions detected at expansion time

        .byte   "Bad expression"
        .endm

; try to expand it

; nest it inside another definition

        .macro  badbody2
