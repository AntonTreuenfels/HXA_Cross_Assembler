; - unmatched block

        .listfile
        .errfile

; -------------------------------

; we can get by with only one test file by using self-inclusion
; (probably not a trick of much use in any other context!)

        .if !defined(INCTEST)

; -------------------------------

        .cpu    "T_16_L"    ; required psop
        .org    $1000       ; required psop

; -------------------------------

        .macro  INCTEST
        .endmacro

        .include    "test250f.a"

; -------------------------------

; this is our test: the previous IF is now unbalanced

;        .endif      ; defined(INCTEST)

; -------------------------------

; - the block arrangement at the end of the inclusion looks like this:
;   if              INCTEST is not defined, so an inclusion happens
;   include
;   if              INCTEST is defined, so no further inclusion

; - there are actually two unclosed IFs, but only open blocks up to
; the INCLUDE are reported (which here consist of one open IF block)
; - the other is not reported because the first is fatal anyway

; -------------------------------

; we want to check response at end of include file,
; not end of assembly, so we comment this out

;        .end
